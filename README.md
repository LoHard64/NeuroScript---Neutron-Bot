**This is the beginning of the journey Neutron AI**<br>
Start in 28 January 2023, I was developing an WhatsApp Bot based on ChatGPT and DallE to help my friends struggle in the class. The reason why I'm interested in developing this Bot is non other than to increase my skills in Programming, especially when it comes to AI (Artificial Intelligence).

**Based on multifunctional WhatsApp Bot**<br>
During my development, I struggle to add features other than ChatGPT and Dall E to make the bot really useful than just AI, and then I started searching entire Internet and found the guy who make multifunctional WhatsApp Bot [thanks to that guy i forgot the name], However, is it many bugs, many codes are written untidily, many weaknesses in there, and me as a developer can't work much of it, so it is Abandoned and never be done yet.

**So, is it not working?** <br>
Several features may work, but many bugs and errors out there. so I recommended to not using it until I release another better one.

**When will you continue to develop this?** <br>
I will continue developing again as I learn something about Backend, JavaScript, Python, and AI. I will create another WhatsApp Bot. The exact release date can't be announced yet because I'm working hard to maintain consistency for learning and developing.
